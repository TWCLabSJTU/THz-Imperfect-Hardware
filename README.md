# DNN-based Two-stage Compensation Algorithm for THz Hybrid Beamforming with Imperfect Hardware

This repository provides a demonstration of our proposed two-stage compensation algorithm for THz hybrid beamforming systems under hardware impairments. The method is based on deep neural networks and effectively mitigates the performance loss caused by practical RF imperfections.
